            <p>I thought I'd start jotting down notes on my hobby projects here.
                Inspired by <a href="https://garten.salat.dev/meta/youre-doing-computing-wrong.html">this post</a>,
                I've decided to try to stay as un-stuck, aka 'slippy' as possible, and just post things, no matter how
                messy, small, incomplete, or inconsequential they may be.
                I have no idea if it will help me or anyone else, but it's worth a try.

            <p>It's been a while since I've done any hobby graphics programming; however I recently re-watched the
                brilliant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r8pxIogxZ0">'Absolute Territory'</a>
                by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/prismbeings.com">'Prismbeings'</a> aka Noby.</p>
            <p>The thing is with me and shadertoy is that I love to just sketch out an idea, and I have noticed that I
                often repeat the same patterns.</p>
            <p>This isnt a bad thing! I've come to think of it as a sort of 'personal style' - I love noise, I love
                softness, I love fog, scattering. My old motto at siggraph was for years, <b>'blur and add noise'</b>
                and it seems I will never escape that.</p>
            <p>however blurring in shadertoy is a bit of a faff (ok not much, but more than 0) so I thought - what if I
                jitter the pixel by a sharp, long tailed distribution?</p>
            <p>The cauchy distribution is the right vibe here; gaussian is too fat in the middle, giving soggy blurry
                look. Cauchy - which is basically, a disc sample where the random radii follow tan(Z*pi/2) rather than
                the usual sqrt(Z) - means that most points end up near their proper place,
                but a few get thrown out - potentially all the way to infinity. (think of tan shooting up to its
                vertical asymptote).</p>
            <p>Beyond that one idea, I just borrowed liberally from Noby's original aeesthetic - Ryoji Ikeda, 4k
                edition, if you like. Sometimes when you're starting up again,
                it's helpful to 'borrow' from someone you really respect. And Noby is a master of minimalism. </p>
            <p>It's easy to miss some of the smaller choices that he makes that make all the difference IMHO: a long
                lens / aka small FOV gives it a cinematic instead of gameish aesthetic;
                the complete lack of colour is a real vibe - I actually don't like when colour comes into the original
                demo. I tried adding a dash, and it hurt the look. so I stayed b&w.</p>
            <p>I changed the lighting a bit, and the shader ended up departing a bit from the original - but I was
                having fun!</p>
            <p>The code is very simple - unidirectional path tracer, diffuse only - well, nearly only - a bit of fresnel
                on the sphere. and some mirrors. That's it! have a look. </p>
            <p>I really enjoyed this, and hope to do more. Obvious alex-ish things to add would be fog, perhaps some
                caustics... who knows. Fun for the fuuture.</p>
