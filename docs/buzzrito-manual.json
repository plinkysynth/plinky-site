It pairs really well with Bib (fx) and Blueberry (sequencer) but easily integrates into any eurorack setup that can provide gate and pitch (V/Oct).</p>\n<p>Buzzy is a very simple module to use: Pitch and Gate go into the left-most jacks, and glorious, wide stereo, plinky-like buzzing comes out of the right-most jacks. The main surface is a large 2D (XY) touch plate, with 7 presets scattered across its surface. Touching at a particular point changes the sound immediately, while dragging your finger records a looping automation following your finger movement, animating the sound. The remaining two jacks, X and Y, allow voltage control over this 2D morphing between presets. From simple triangle-tones in the bottom left, to rasping comb filtered super-saws at top right, Buzzy is a characterful oscillator in a small package. </p>\n<h2 id=\"specs\">Specs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Synthesis:<ul>\n<li>16 Sawtooth oscillators</li>\n<li>1 Triangle sub-oscillator</li>\n<li>1 comb filter</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Current draw: <ul>\n<li>100mA +12V</li>\n<li>5mA -12V</li>\n<li>5V not required</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Size: <ul>\n<li>12HP 1U (Intellijel format)</li>\n<li>27mm (including power)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"one-page-cheat-sheet\">One page cheat sheet</h2>\n<p><a href=\"buzzrito_manual.png\" target=\"blank\"><img src=\"buzzrito_manual.png\"></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"patch-editor\">Patch editor</h2>\n<p>Buzzrito presents as an XY pad that allows you to morph between 7 sounds across the 2D surface. But what if you want to edit those sounds? You are in the right place! Simply connect Buzzy to your PC/Mac&#39;s browser via a usb-C cable, and assuming your browser supports WebUSB (you can check <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://caniuse.com/?search=webusb\">here</a>) you can use the UI below to edit the presets live. After you&#39;ve finished editing, wait at least 5 seconds before powering down your buzzrito (so that it can save your changes to its flash storage).</p>\n<iframe id=\"embedded-frame\" src=\"/buzzy_presets.html\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<script>\n  window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {\n    console.log(event.data);\n    if (event.data && event.data.height) {\n      const iframe = document.getElementById('embedded-frame');\n      iframe.style.height = event.data.height + 'px';\n    }\n  });\n</script>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a demo of the above editor, if you&#39;re not sure what I am talking about:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rJC73ZvjzAI?si=aJrhNecRch8Lq6A5\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<h2 id=\"firmware\">Firmware</h2>\n<p>First, download the latest firmware in this file: <a href=\"buddies-firmware/buzzrito_001.uf2\"><code>buzzrito_001.uf2</code></a>.\nUse a USB-C cable (not included) to plug your computer into Buzzrito. You do <strong>not</strong> need Buzzrito to be powered from eurorack for this step. </p>\n<p>Buzzrito should show up as a USB drive called <code>RPI-RP2</code> (on mac, you may find it under <code>/Volumes/RPI-RP2</code>). If it does not, try disconnecting the USB cable, holding down the <em>tiny</em> button on the digital board, just  opposite to the USB connector (hilighted below), while reconnecting the cable - then release the button. If it <em>still</em> doesn&#39;t show up, make sure your cable has data lines (and isn&#39;t just for charging).</p>\n<p>Drag and drop or otherwise copy the downloaded file onto the RPI-RP2 folder, and after a second Buzzrito should reboot, flashing some LEDs. You&#39;re ready to buzz!</p>\n<h2 id=\"patch-notes-versions\">Patch notes &amp; versions</h2>\n<h2 id=\"v1-end-october-2024-thonk-edition-\">v1 - End October 2024 - &#39;Thonk edition&#39;</h2>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"buddies-firmware/buzzrito_001.uf2\">Download here: buzzrito_001.uf2</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.</li>\n</ul>\n","date":"2024-10-29T18:38:00.000Z","excerpt":"","printDate":"October 29, 2024","toc":[{"anchor":"meet-buzzrito-a-large-bee-presiding-over-16-sawtooth-oscillators-a-sub-oscillator-and-a-peaky-comb-filter-all-in-just-12hp-1u-","level":2,"text":"Meet Buzzrito, a large bee presiding over 16 sawtooth oscillators, a sub oscillator, and a peaky comb-filter, all in just 12HP 1U."},{"anchor":"overview","level":2,"text":"Overview"},{"anchor":"specs","level":2,"text":"Specs"},{"anchor":"one-page-cheat-sheet","level":2,"text":"One page cheat sheet"},{"anchor":"patch-editor","level":2,"text":"Patch editor"},{"anchor":"firmware","level":2,"text":"Firmware"},{"anchor":"patch-notes-versions","level":2,"text":"Patch notes &amp; versions"},{"anchor":"v1-end-october-2024-thonk-edition-","level":2,"text":"v1 - End October 2024 - &#39;Thonk edition&#39;"}]}
