{"title":"Plinky / Plinky+ Manual","slug":"manual","html":"<img src=\"plinky_alpha_2.png\" alt=\"Remove the back panel\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\n<p>Plinky is an 8 voice polyphonic touch synthesiser that specialises in fragile, melancholic sounds.</p>\n<p>Think of it as an 8 stringed instrument, played by touching the 64 main pads, which are arranged in 8 vertical monophonic strips or strings. You can play Plinky straight away with those 64 main pads. </p>\n<p>Each of the 8 strings has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Up to 4 oscillators (pulse, supersaw or wavetable) or sampler grains, detuned by the movements of your finger.</li>\n<li>A white noise generator</li>\n<li>Two ADSR envelopes</li>\n<li>A resonant 2-pole low-pass gate.</li>\n<li>Distortion / saturation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The 8 shift keys (blue LEDs) are used in conjunction with the main pads to select parameters, presets, sequencer patterns, and samples.</p>\n<p>Plinky supports 4 external CV modulation sources, called A B X Y, each with its own LFO.\nA and B also have dedicated physical offset knobs, located to the left of the screen. When changing parameters you can use the endless encoder to the right of the screen to fine tune the parameter settings. Clicking the encoder also resets the current parameter.</p>\n<p>Plinky also has global Delay, Reverb, High Pass Filter, Limiter and Saturation units along with a simple Mixer (for audio inputs), Arpeggiator, Sequencer and Sampler.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-quickest-start\">The Quickest Start</h2>\n<p>Whether you are completely new to Plinky, or just looking for a quick refresher, here is a 10 minute guide to playing Plinky.

If you read this manual, you either have a pre-assembled Plinky in front of you, or you have successfully built your Plinky from a DIY kit. Welcome to the Plinky user community! We hope you make and share lots of beautiful music – or pure plain filth if you&#39;re into that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"powering-plinky\">Powering Plinky</h3>\n<p>To power Plinky or Plinky+, connect them to a USB power supply. Either draws around 400 mA from a 5V supply, so any USB phone charger, including older ones with a USB A port, should suffice. </p>\n<p>On the original Plinky, you can use either one of the USB connectors on the front or the back (but again, don&#39;t use both at the same time!). The original Plinky can also be powered from a Eurorack power supply. Note that your supply needs a 5V bus. </p>\n<p>Plinky+ has a dedicated power button. Connect the USB power supply and push the on/off button on the back panel to power it on. While Plinky+ does not come with a built-in battery, it has the circuitry and a connector that lets you <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"../docs/build-guide-plus#installing-a-battery-pack\">retrofit a battery pack</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"calibration\">Calibration</h3>\n<p>At first power up, (or when you wiggle knob A during the power up,) Plinky will start in Calibration mode. What this does is map the exact size and positioning of your fingers to where it will register a pad being played. For example if you play Plinky from an angle, you will touch the faceplate slightly differently. Calibration compensates for this. </p>\n<p>One white LED in each column will light up. Touch this in the center and the next one will light up. Touch that one in the center, and so on, making sure that the pressure is consistent on each pad.If your finger lands a bit off center from a pad, just slide it into place without lifting it off and leave it for a moment. Do this until all white LEDs have been calibrated and do the same for the Blue LEDs (the shift keys). You are now done.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TIP: if you have large fingers, try calibrating with your little finger! Some people have found that this leads to more responsive playing after calibration.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you make a mistake during the calibration, just unplug and replug the USB cable. If you ever want to re-calibrate, (for example, because you&#39;ve moved Plinky into or out of your Eurorack, or even if you&#39;ve moved it around,) just wiggle knob A during power up. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We&#39;ve found that changing the power supply you use, or the case that Plinky is in, can affect calibration. If you find that Plinky isn&#39;t responding correctly, it&#39;s definitely worth re-calibrating. We recommend trying a few different power supplys, as different supplies seem to lead to quite different sensitivities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"connect-your-headphones-or-speakers\">Connect your Headphones or Speakers</h3>\n<h4 id=\"plinky\">Plinky</h4>\n<p>Plinky has two headphone outputs, on the front side and the back side. For each one, it is located to the right of the USB.  </p>\n<p><strong>Phones Top:</strong>     a 3.5 mm TRS stereo headphone jack, on the top, right of the USB\n</br><strong>Phones Bottom:</strong>     a 3.5 mm TRS stereo headphone jack, on the bottom, right of the USB\n</br><strong>Euro L/R:</strong>   a 3.5 mm TS stereo pair, Eurorack level, the first two jacks top right on the panel.</p>\n<p>The jack input on the left is the audio input (for effect processing or sampling).</p>\n<h4 id=\"plinky-\">Plinky+</h4>\n<p>Plinky+ has three audio outputs at the back, all of which can be used simultaneously. Set the gain using the volume knob on the front panel.</p>\n<p><strong>Main L/R:</strong>   a symmetrical 6.3 mm TRS stereo pair\n</br><strong>Euro L/R:</strong>   a 3.5 mm TS stereo pair, Eurorack level\n</br><strong>Phones:</strong>     a 3.5 mm TRS stereo headphone jack</p>\n<p>The two audio inputs, both 3.5 mm TRS stereo jacks, are meant for effect processing or sampling.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TIP: Plinky / Plinky+ has an analog saturation circuit. While the line inputs are designed for a stereo line level signal, you can actually run full eurorack level &#39;hot&#39; signals into Plinky here, and get a really crunchy overdriven sound. Voilà! you can use Plinky as a saturation/fuzz box. The stereo Eurorack input jack has a lower gain, and will saturate less.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You are now ready to Plink.</p>\n<h3 id=\"play-plinky-\">Play Plinky!</h3>\n<p>Each of the center pads plays a note. Plinky is either playing a blank preset, which is a 4 voice unison Saw wave for each of the &#39;strings&#39;, or you are playing one of the factory presets. Plinky can play 8 voices polyphony.

The LEDs light up while you have your fingers held down on the pads. Then release all your fingers. While in parameter edit mode, both the shift button and the icon pads&#39; LEDs will pulse. </p>\n<p>The screen always shows the device you are editing in the upper half and the parameter in the lower half. The pads with blue instead of white LEDs are the shift / transport / mode buttons - you can find them the bottom row on Plinky and the leftmost column on Plinky+. </p>\n<div markdown>\n\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/shift-top.svg\" alt=\"Shift Top\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/shift-bottom.svg\" alt=\"Shift Bottom\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/preset.svg\" alt=\"Preset\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/previous.svg\" alt=\"Previous\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/next.svg\" alt=\"Next\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/clear.svg\" alt=\"Clear\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/record.svg\" alt=\"Record\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/play.svg\" alt=\"Play\"> </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s use this workflow to add some Delay to your sound. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/shift-top.svg\" alt=\"Shift Top\"> <em>hold</em>\n<img src=\"/manual-images/delay--reverb.svg\" alt=\"Delay\"> <em>tap</em></p>\n<p>Tap and hold SHIFT TOP, the primary parameter editing button. Tap the DELAY pad in the third row. This is the send level to the Delay. Slide your finger upwards on the Arrow column of pads, which now acts as a slider, to increase the amount of Delay. To hear this, play any of the pads other than the Shift pads or Arrow column. </p>\n<p>Play and tweak. Alternatively, you can twist the encoder to adjust the value finely. Click the encoder to reset the value to default. Tap the SHIFT TOP button to return to regular play mode, where you can use the Arrow column for playing notes. This is the basic workflow for creating patches on Plinky!</p>\n<h3 id=\"adding-modulation\">Adding Modulation</h3>\n<div markdown>\n\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/shift-top.svg\" alt=\"Shift Top\"> <em>hold</em>\n<img src=\"/manual-images/distortion--resonance.svg\" alt=\"Distortion\"> <em>tap</em>\n<img src=\"/manual-images/mod-src--a.svg\" alt=\"Mod Source A\"> <em>tap</em></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Adding modulation has a similar workflow. You tap and hold down a SHIFT button, and select a parameter to enter parameter edit mode like before, but now you keep on holding down the SHIFT button and tap one of the mod sources (the right most column of pads). </p>\n<div markdown>\n\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/mod-src--envelope-2.svg\" alt=\"Mod Source Envelope 2\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/mod-src--sensitivity.svg\" alt=\"Mod Source Pressure\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/mod-src--a.svg\" alt=\"Modulator A\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/mod-src--b.svg\" alt=\"Modulator B\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/mod-src--x.svg\" alt=\"Modulator X\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/mod-src--y.svg\" alt=\"Modulator Y\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/mod-src--random.svg\" alt=\"Random\"></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Let’s use the physical knob at the top left of Plinky to adjust overdrive.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/shift-top.svg\" alt=\"Shift Top\"> <em>hold</em>\n<img src=\"/manual-images/distortion--resonance.svg\" alt=\"Distortion\"> <em>tap</em>\n<img src=\"/manual-images/mod-src--a.svg\" alt=\"Mod Source A\"> <em>tap</em></p>\n<p>Hold Down SHIFT TOP again, then tap drive (in the first row) to select distortion. While still holding down SHIFT TOP, tap the MODULATOR A pad on the right column. What you are saying is, &#39;I want to link modulation source A to the parameter distortion&#39;. </p>\n<p>Now you&#39;ll see three blinking LEDs: the shift button, the parameter pad and the modulation pad. The screen still shows the parameter you are editing in the lower half, but the upper half now shows the modulation source instead of the sound device. </p>\n<p>You have now linked the modulation source, but you also have to tell Plinky how much that modulation should impact the distortion. You do this with the Arrow slider, or the encoder for fine adjustments. In this case we want the knob to control the full distortion range, so we turn it all the way up with the slider. </p>\n<p>Turning the knob fully counter clockwise adds 0% overdrive, turning it all the way clockwise adds 100% overdrive. Now, the physical knob at the top left of Plinky will control overdrive. To return to play mode, tap SHIFT TOP.</p>\n<p>That’s as complex as it gets! You now know everything you need to know to play, edit patches and modulate. Enjoy! Details follow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removing-modulation\">Removing Modulation</h3>\n<p>To remove a parameter&#39;s modulation, simply repeat the steps as described above, and turn modulation amount back to 0% (clicking the encoder is perfect for this). </p>\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/mod-src--base.svg\" alt=\"Modulator Base\"> To see which modulation sources are linked to a parameter, select it and check which of the modulator LEDs light up. Use MODULATOR Base to switch between &#39;base value&#39; and &#39;modulation amount&#39;</p>\n<h1 id=\"plinky-hardware\">Plinky hardware</h1>\n<p>Let’s take a look at Plinky’s inputs and outputs on the top and bottom edges. They have identical functions, and both can be used. On each side you find:</p>\n<h4 id=\"audio-in-line-level-stereo-\">Audio in (line level stereo)</h4>\n<p>A TRS, 3.5 mm audio jack. Useful for two things. Plinky’s sampler can sample 65 seconds of incoming audio. Additionally, Plinky can act as a mixer with effects (Reverb and Delay), where each of Plinky’s audio inputs are mixed with Plinky’s internal audio. The individual inputs are mixed at unity gain, but the levels of the summed inputs and the internal sounds can be set separately. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remember, if you have Plinky V2 (with the blue main board) you can and absolutely should try running Eurorack signals through Line level inputs to enloy that crunchy analog saturation. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"usb\">USB</h4>\n<p>The USB jack is either USB Micro-b on v1/v2, or USB-C on v3.

If you have a 3.7V Lithium Ion pack with charge protection connected to the JST connector on Plinky+&#39;s main board, you can use the USB-C port to charge the Battery with a 1A rate.</p>\n<p>The USB window will glow red while the Battery is charging, and switches to blue once fully charged.</p>\n<h1 id=\"main-interface\">Main Interface</h1>\n<p>Plinky is built around 64 playable ‘pads’. Actually they are not really pads, they are zones on a vertical strip. By calibrating Plinky’s touch strips, we make them function as pads. </p>\n<h3 id=\"knobs-a-and-b\">Knobs A and B</h3>\n<p>These two knobs act as offsets for modulator A and B respectively. Modulator A is the sum of LFO A, CV input A and the offset of the button. These modulators can be assigned to all the parameters.</p>\n<h3 id=\"encoder\">Encoder</h3>\n<p>The push encoder is used to set parameter values. Values can often be negative and positive, where different types of units correspond to the positive or negative values (eg. in the shape parameter, negative values modulate the Pulsewidth of a pulse wave, at 0 it is a supersaw, when positive it is a wavetable).</p>\n<p>The encoder remains tied to the parameter that was last edited, even when Plinky is not in parameter edit mode. </p>\n<p>When pushed, the encoder will snap the parameter value back to 0. This is useful to remove modulation from a parameter. A long push on the encoder  clears the modulation.</p>\n<p>Press and hold the push encoder down while plugging Plinky into power and it will enter the &quot;tunnel of lights&quot; mode where you can update the firmware or change presets. See <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://plinkysynth.com/presets\">https://plinkysynth.com/presets</a> for details. </p>\n<h3 id=\"volume-knob-plinky-\">Volume Knob (Plinky+)</h3>\n<p>Plinky+ has three audio outputs at the back, all of which can be used simultaneously. The volume knob on the front panel sets the level for all three.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/shift-top.svg\" alt=\"Shift Top\"> <em>hold</em>\n<img src=\"/manual-images/volume.svg\" alt=\"Volume\"> <em>tap</em></p>\n<p>On the original Plinky, to set the volume, hold SHIFT TOP and tap VOLUME. Use the Encoder or Arrow column to dial in the gain. This sets the level of the final output stage for the headphone out. Tap SHIFT TOP again to exit shift mode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"screen\">Screen</h3>\n<p>Plinky&#39;s screen shows a lot of useful information. There are three modes, and they each have their own interface on the screen: Play mode, Parameter Edit mode, and Sampler mode.</p>\n<h4 id=\"play-mode\">Play mode</h4>\n<p>The screen shows the last note played on the top left. The bottom left shows the current Arp / Sequencer pattern. To the right of it, we see whether a sample is selected, and if so, which one. The center shows a nice big waveform of what’s being played through the Mixer stage. On the right side, a narrow bar shows the current pressure (max from each of the strings) that is being applied to the pads. Also on the right, you see 4 small visualisations of Modulator / LFO A, B, X and Y.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sampler-mode\">Sampler Mode</h4>\n<p>In Sampler mode you will see a large visualisation of the sample with vertical bars representing one of the 8 slice points. A small number to the right of this bar tells you which slide it is. </p>\n<p>On the bottom left we see the mode the sampler is in (tape/pitch). When in pitch mode, we see the base note of the current slide. On the bottom right we see the sampler playback mode (all, loop, loop all).</p>\n<h4 id=\"parameter-edit-mode\">Parameter edit mode</h4>\n<p>Top left shows the device you are currently editing (Sound, Envelope, Delay, Reverb, Arp, Sequencer, A, B, X, Y, Sampler, Mixer, System).\nBottom left shows which parameter of the current device is being edited.</p>\n<p>On the right we still see the pressure bar and the modulators. In the center we see one or two parameter values. In the upper half of the screen we see a big number, which is the current actual value of the parameter. When no modulation is applied, you will only see the big value, because the the base value and the total is equal, which you set with the slider or the encoder. </p>\n<p>When modulation is applied, you will see 2 numbers. The small number in the lower half of the screen is the base value of the preset, the large number in the upper half is the sum of the base values and all modulation. This means that the base value is a static number, while the current value will change with the modulation (for example, an LFO). The small value is the one you can set with the slider/encoder, and the large value is the result of this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shift-keys\">Shift Keys</h2>\n<div markdown>\n\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/shift-top.svg\" alt=\"Shift Top\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/shift-bottom.svg\" alt=\"Shift Bottom\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/preset.svg\" alt=\"Preset\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/previous.svg\" alt=\"Previous\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/next.svg\" alt=\"Next\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/clear.svg\" alt=\"Clear\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/record.svg\" alt=\"Record\"> \n<img src=\"/manual-images/play.svg\" alt=\"Play\"> </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The pads with blue LEDs are shift and transport controls.

Why two? They map to two complete sets of parameters – primary (top) on SHIFT TOP and secondary (bottom) on SHIFT BOTTOM, corresponding to the parameters that are written above and below each of the pads. Tap or hold either, then tap an icon pads to choose a parameter to edit.</p>\n<p>Once in edit mode, adjust the chosen parameter using the left most column of pads as a slider, or use the encoder to the right of the screen. While in this mode you can play all the pads, except for the pads in the Arrow column (slider). Tap again to return to play mode (LED off). </p>\n<h4 id=\"preset\">Preset</h4>\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/preset.svg\" alt=\"Preset\">  <strong>Preset Mode</strong> Tap or hold, then tap a main pad to select a preset (left 32 pads), pattern (middle 24), or sample (right 8). The sections are labelled at the top. A long press on a sample pad will edit it; on other pads, it will copy the current preset / pattern to it. Press and hold CLEAR to clear the last touched preset or pattern.</p>\n<h4 id=\"previous\">Previous</h4>\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/previous.svg\" alt=\"Previous\"> <strong>Previous Button</strong> Tap to jump to the previous step (sequencer paused) or first step (sequencer playing). Hold it, then tap a main pad to jump to a step within the current loop, or to set a new loop start outside the current loop.</p>\n<h4 id=\"next\">Next</h4>\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/next.svg\" alt=\"Next\"> <strong>Next Button</strong> Tap to jump to the next step.<br>Hold it, then tap a main pad to set the end of the current loop.</p>\n<h4 id=\"clear\">Clear</h4>\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/clear.svg\" alt=\"Clear\"> <strong>Clear Button</strong> Tap or hold to clear stuff. Useful to mute recorded notes, live, while the sequencer is playing. If recording, this will permanently clear steps.\nIn preset mode, hold this after tapping a main pad to clear whole patterns or re-initialize presets. </p>\n<h4 id=\"record-and-play\">Record and Play</h4>\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/record.svg\" alt=\"Record\"> <img src=\"/manual-images/play.svg\" alt=\"Play\"> <strong>Play / Record Buttons</strong> Tap to toggle playback and recording.\nRecording can be step based (when sequencer is paused) or realtime (when sequencer is playing). When you enter a note (or multiple notes, the sequencer is polyphonic) the sequencer jumps to the next step.</p>\n<h2 id=\"center-pads-and-leds\">Center Pads and LEDs</h2>\n<p>The pads have two functions. Their primary role is to play notes, in default presets the bottom left pad plays C0. Each pad up is 1 note higher within the selected scale, each string is tuned 7 semitones or a perfect fifth up (but snapped to the closest note in the scale).</p>\n<p>The second function of the pads is to select parameters. The left most column acts as a slider to modify parameter values. The right most column refer to the modulators. The center 48 pads each correspond to 2 parameters, which are printed directly above and below the pad. The parameters are described in the Parameters chapter.</p>\n<p>Each pad also has a white LED. These LEDs have different behaviours in the various modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>In Play mode</strong> the LEDs light up the notes that are being played, as well as the active sequencer step.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>In Preset mode</strong> the LED&#39;s show the active preset, sequencer pattern and current sample (when in sample mode).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>In Parameter mode</strong> the LEDs show both the parameter that is being edited and the modulators that have been assigned to that parameter. So when a parameter is changing unexpectedly, you can select the parameter and then the modulator that is causing the cange will also light up.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"parameters\">Parameters</h1>\n<p>Plinky’s parameters are arranged in somewhat logical horizontal rows. </p>\n<div markdown>\n\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/shift-top.svg\" alt=\"Shift Top\"> <em>hold</em>\n<img src=\"/manual-images/delay--reverb.svg\" alt=\"Delay\"> <em>tap</em></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Remember to hold SHIFT TOP or SHIFT BOTTOM to enter parameter edit mode, then tap a pad with an icon to select that parameter. The left most column then becomes a dedicated slider, or you can use the encoder right of the screen. </p>\n<p>Pressing SHIFT TOP or SHIFT BOTTOM again returns to play mode, with all 64 pads available to play. This is the main workflow when making patches with Plinky.</p>\n<p>The Arrow column of pads is a slider. The rightmost column of pads are modulation sources. We’ll cover those later. The middle 6 columns are the parameters themselves. From top to bottom, they are:</p>\n<h1 id=\"sound-synthesizer-\">Sound (Synthesizer)</h1>\n<h4 id=\"shape\">Shape</h4>\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/shift-top.svg\" alt=\"Shift Top\"> <em>hold</em>\n<img src=\"/manual-images/shape.svg\" alt=\"Shape\"> <em>tap</em>\nControls the shape of the oscillators in Plinky. When exactly 0%, you get  4 sawtooths per voice. When positive, you blend smoothly through 16 ROM wavetable shapes, (2 per voice,) provided by @miunau. When negative, you get PWM control of pulse/square shapes, (also 2 per voice.)</p>\n<p>CV and internal modulation only work either positive or negative: you can blend through the wavetables when the parameter is over 0, or you can modulate pulse/square waves when the value is negative. You cant cross through zero.</p>\n<p>Plinky pans each set of oscillators, (and the sample grains) a little giving the sound a rich stereo field. With the supersaw, we have 2 oscilators panned left and 2 panned right. With the wavetable and pulse oscilators 1 is panned left and 1 is panned right.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tip: Honestly, just play with this one for a bit. Assign it to a knob, play an arp or pads and listen to the rich, full scope of sounds Plinky will play. From there on see for yourself. Add an envelope to it, or let pressure modulate the timbre of the sound.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can find a number of alternate wavetables for Plinky on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/plinkysynth/wavetable\">github</a>.  The repository also has a python script that lets you convert your own wavetables to Plinky&#39;s format. Wavetable files come in the form of <code>WAVETAB.UF2</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"noise\">Noise</h4>\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/shift-bottom.svg\" alt=\"Shift Bottom\"> <em>hold</em>\n<img src=\"/manual-images/noise.svg\" alt=\"Noise\"> <em>tap</em>\nEach voice can add a variable amount of white noise to the oscillator, before the low-pass gate. Try assigning an envelope to the noise parameter. An envelope with a short attack and decay will give a percussive feel, while longer attack will ‘wash over’ the sound which is more suitable for pads.</p>\n<h4 id=\"drive\">Drive</h4>\n<p><img src=\"/manual-images/shift-top.svg\" alt=\"Shift Top\"> <em>hold</em>\n<img src=\"/manual-images/distortion--resonance.svg\" alt=\"Distortion\"> <em>tap</em>\nWhen turned up high, the saturation unit will create guitar-like tones, especially when playing polyphonically.
