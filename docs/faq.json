It blinks in time to the BPM.</p>\n<h3 id=\"where-is-the-lpf-\">Where is the LPF?</h3>\n<p>You can change the LPF under &quot;Sensitivity&quot;. It is tied to the pressure sensitivity by default.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-save-presets-\">Can I save presets?</h3>\n<p>Yes! Just hold the preset button (the paper icon) and the lights on the left are your presets. Hold to save.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-about-sequences-\">How about sequences?</h3>\n<p>Yes! Same deal, the lights on the right are sequences when you hold the preset button.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sound\">Sound</h2>\n<h3 id=\"what-sampling-rate-is-plinky-running-at-\">What sampling rate is Plinky running at?</h3>\n<p>Plinky runs at 32kHz stereo.</p>\n<h3 id=\"oscillator-shapes\">Oscillator shapes</h3>\n<p>When looking at the SHAPE option, you can sweep through several waveforms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Below 0 (-100% to 0%) are algorithmic oscillator modes (sine, saw, square).</li>\n<li>At 0, the mode is a pure supersaw.</li>\n<li>Above 0 (0% to +100%) you can find a wavetable constructed by sampling a Polivoks synthesizer running through a Sherman Filterbank, sampled through an API 512c preamp and 550A EQ into RME A/D.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Modulation is locked at these 3 stages relative to the base value. For example, if you set the base value above 0 and assign an LFO to the shape, the LFO will cause a sweep through the wavetable modes. At 0, modulation will affect the supersaw. Below 0, it will sweep through the algorithmic oscillator.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tech-specs\">Tech specs</h2>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-cpu-in-plinky-\">What is the CPU in Plinky?</h3>\n<p>It&#39;s a STM32l476VGT6 (or 475).</p>\n<h2 id=\"mac\">Mac</h2>\n<h3 id=\"install-firmware-mac-m1-os-14-\">Install firmware (Mac M1+ / OS 14+)</h3>\n<p>In UF2 (tunnel of light) mode, Plinky has been unhappy to automatically mount on some Mac OS versions (14 and higher). </p>\n<p>Upgrading to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://plinkysynth.com/firmware/\">Firmware 0.A7</a> fixes this issue.
