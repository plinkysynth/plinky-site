It blinks in time to the BPM.</p>\n<h3 id=\"where-is-the-lpf-\">Where is the LPF?</h3>\n<p>You can change the LPF under &quot;Sensitivity&quot;. It is tied to the pressure sensitivity by default.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-save-presets-\">Can I save presets?</h3>\n<p>Yes! Just hold the preset button (the paper icon) and the lights on the left are your presets. Hold to save.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-about-sequences-\">How about sequences?</h3>\n<p>Yes! Same deal, the lights on the right are sequences when you hold the preset button.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sound\">Sound</h2>\n<h3 id=\"what-sampling-rate-is-plinky-running-at-\">What sampling rate is Plinky running at?</h3>\n<p>Plinky runs at 32kHz stereo.</p>\n<h3 id=\"oscillator-shapes\">Oscillator shapes</h3>\n<p>When looking at the SHAPE option, you can sweep through several waveforms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Below 0 (-100% to 0%) are algorithmic oscillator modes (sine, saw, square).</li>\n<li>At 0, the mode is a pure supersaw.</li>\n<li>Above 0 (0% to +100%) you can find a wavetable constructed by sampling a Polivoks synthesizer running through a Sherman Filterbank, sampled through an API 512c preamp and 550A EQ into RME A/D.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Modulation is locked at these 3 stages relative to the base value. For example, if you set the base value above 0 and assign an LFO to the shape, the LFO will cause a sweep through the wavetable modes. At 0, modulation will affect the supersaw. Below 0, it will sweep through the algorithmic oscillator.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tech-specs\">Tech specs</h2>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-cpu-in-plinky-\">What is the CPU in Plinky?</h3>\n<p>It&#39;s a STM32l476VGT6 (or 475).</p>\n","date":"2021-01-24T08:38:00.000Z","excerpt":"","printDate":"January 24, 2021","toc":[{"anchor":"general-first-timers","level":2,"text":"General first-timers"},{"anchor":"what-is-the-blinking-light-at-the-top-left-","level":3,"text":"What is the blinking light at the top left?"},{"anchor":"where-is-the-lpf-","level":3,"text":"Where is the LPF?"},{"anchor":"can-i-save-presets-","level":3,"text":"Can I save presets?"},{"anchor":"how-about-sequences-","level":3,"text":"How about sequences?"},{"anchor":"sound","level":2,"text":"Sound"},{"anchor":"what-sampling-rate-is-plinky-running-at-","level":3,"text":"What sampling rate is Plinky running at?"},{"anchor":"oscillator-shapes","level":3,"text":"Oscillator shapes"},{"anchor":"tech-specs","level":2,"text":"Tech specs"},{"anchor":"what-is-the-cpu-in-plinky-","level":3,"text":"What is the CPU in Plinky?"}]}
